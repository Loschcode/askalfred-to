            <h3>What does this policy cover</h3>

            <p>Welcome to AskAlfred, a service served by the french company 753-806-413-00013 (“AskAlfred,” “we,” or “us”). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>

            <p>This policy sets out how AskAlfred collects and uses the information that we collect about you when you use the AskAlfred services. This policy also explains the choices that you can make about the way that we use your information.</p>

            <h3>Information we collect and its use</h3>

            <p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

            <h3>Information you provide us directly</h3>

            <p>We may ask for certain information such as a username, your first and last name, birthdate, phone number, profession and e-mail address when you register for an AskAlfred account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in the Requests you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also use this information to correspond with you, and to address any issues you raise about the Service.</p>

            <h3>Information we may receive from third parties</h3>

            <p>We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to AskAlfred. This information could include, but is not limited to, an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services.</p>

            <h3>Information we collect from you automatically</h3>

            <p>We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service.</p>

            <h3>Cookies information</h3>

            <p>When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets AskAlfred help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time.</p>

            <p>You can control or reset your cookies through your web browser, which will allow you to customise your cookie preferences and to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

            <h3>Log file information</h3>

            <p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>

            <h3>Clear gifs/web beacons information</h3>

            <p>When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. This information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>

            <h3>Device identifiers</h3>

            <p>When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by AskAlfred. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>

            <p>When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</p>
