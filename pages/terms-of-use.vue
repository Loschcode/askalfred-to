            <p>ASKALFRED does not provide a guarantee against and cannot be considered responsible for the loss or alteration of files or data that the User transfers to their personal space on the AskAlfred solution.</p>

            <p>ASKALFRED assures the User that his or her Data will be collected and processed in compliance with the provisions of the law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Information Technology, Data Files and Civil Liberties (modified by law no. 2004-801 of 6 August 2004 and law no. 2016-1321 of 7 October 2016 for a Digital Republic) (the "IT and Liberties Law") and, dated from 25 May 2018, of Regulation no. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council dated 27 April 2016 (the "Regulation"), in keeping with its Confidentiality Policy.</p>

            <p>The Confidentiality Policy is an integral part of the General Conditions.</p>

            <p>ASKALFRED undertakes to guarantee the existence of adequate protection levels in keeping with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

            <h3>Article 14. Sanctions</h3>

            <p>If one or more provisions of these General Conditions is violated, or of the contract of subscription as a Client, or any other document written by ASKALFRED, ASKALFRED reserves the right to terminate or limit without any prior warning and at its sole discretion, your use and access to the Livestorm Service, your Account and all other ASKALFRED services.</p>

            <h3>Article 15. Modification of General Conditions – Special Conditions</h3>

            <h4>15.1 Modifications</h4>

            <p>ASKALFRED reserves the right to alter the general conditions at any time.</p>

            <p>Each change will take effect from the time it is put online on the site and on the AskAlfred solution. ASKALFRED undertakes to inform members in advance by email or by a display on the Website and on the AskAlfred solution. The User will have to accept the modification of the General Conditions in order to use the AskAlfred Service.</p>

            <h4>15.2 Services</h4>

            <p>Each service may be subject to special conditions.</p>

            <p>ASKALFRED is free to add and to delete AskAlfred services and/or to alter their characteristics, conditions of use and other special conditions. It will inform members about this in advance by email or by a display on the site and on the Livestorm solution.</p>

            <p>Within the context of using the AskAlfred Service or by its intermediation, the User may be led to make use of or access content provided by third parties.

You agree to comply with these additional general conditions. If there is a contradiction between these General Conditions and the conditions published for, or applicable to, a specific section of Livestorm or for a service offered on or via the Livestorm solution, the latter conditions shall take precedence and shall govern use of this section of Livestorm or this specific service.</p>

            <p>When applicable, ASKALFRED's obligations in relation to its Products and Services are governed only by the agreements in the terms of which they were defined and no element appearing on the AskAlfred solution can be interpreted in such a way as to modify these agreements.</p>

            <p>ASKALFRED may make changes to the Products and Services offered on the site and on the AskAlfred solution or at prices applicable to these Products and Services at any time and without prior warning.</p>

            <h3>Article 17 – Applicable law – Competent jurisdiction</h3>

            <p>These General Conditions are governed by French law.</p>

            <p>The French version shall take precedence over any other version of the General Conditions.</p>

            <p>In case of disputes or claims from the User, ASKALFRED or a third party, concerning use of the Service, only the version of these General Conditions accessible on the Website and on the AskAlfred solution will have binding force between the parties, whatever the date of the disputed facts.</p>

            <p>In the absence of an amicable solution, any dispute that may arise between the parties in relation to the formation, execution, interpretation or cancellation/termination of the Contract will be under the exclusive competency of the competent French courts in Paris, including cases of proceedings for interim measures (“référé”, “requête”) or those involving a plurality of defenders.</p>
